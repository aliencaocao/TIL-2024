When PyTorch is installed with conda, mim gives "KeyError: 'pkg_resources'". So we have to install mmengine and mmcv with pip as follows:
pip install mmengine
pip install mmcv==2.1.0 -f https://download.openmmlab.com/mmcv/dist/cu118/torch2.1/index.html

We use mmcv==2.1.0 because the latest mmdet is only compatible with mmcv>=2.0.0,<2.2.

Install albumentations for augmentation:
pip install -U albumentations

Need to download Punkt tokenizer for NLTK, otherwise validation will fail:
```
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt', download_dir='/home/jupyter/nltk_data')
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger', download_dir='/home/jupyter/nltk_data')
```
Can't use '~/nltk_data' because it creates a new directory in the current working directory called '~' (yes, a tilde) and puts nltk_data in there.
