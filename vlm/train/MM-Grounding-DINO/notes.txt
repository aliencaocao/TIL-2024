When PyTorch is installed with conda, mim gives "KeyError: 'pkg_resources'". So we have to install mmengine and mmcv with pip as follows:
pip install mmengine
pip install mmcv==2.1.0 -f https://download.openmmlab.com/mmcv/dist/cu118/torch2.1/index.html

We use mmcv==2.1.0 because the latest mmdet is only compatible with mmcv>=2.0.0,<2.2.
