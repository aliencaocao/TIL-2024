https://github.com/TIL-24/til-24-base/assets/162278270/5e42363d-9f01-4626-8d70-cc7dc8e48c71

Note that the above example is in `mp4` format as GitHub does not support embedding `.wav` files in README files. However, audio files provided on GCP will be `.wav` files.

## Augmentations

Training was conducted with the following audiomentations augs:

HighShelfFilter(max_gain_db=6.0, p=0.3), \
LowShelfFilter(max_gain_db=6.0, p=0.3), \
BandStopFilter(p=0.3), \
TimeStretch(min_rate=0.9, max_rate=1.1, p=0.3) 


## Output

Transcription of audio file. Example: `"Heading is one five zero, target is green commercial aircraft, tool to deploy is electromagnetic pulse."`
