# NLP

## Docker
Build base (only 1-time):
```shell
docker build -f base.dockerfile -t 12000sgd-nlp-base .
```
Build image with model:
```shell
docker build -t 12000sgd-nlp .
```
Test:
```shell
docker run -p 5002:5002 --gpus all -d 12000sgd-nlp
```
Submit:
```shell
docker tag 12000sgd-nlp asia-southeast1-docker.pkg.dev/dsta-angelhack/repository-12000sgdplushie/12000sgd-nlp:latest
docker push asia-southeast1-docker.pkg.dev/dsta-angelhack/repository-12000sgdplushie/12000sgd-nlp:latest

# ExLlamaV2
1. [Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VLaP60DxsysOVPCQGFHGR8AR67hzhML6/view) OR Build wheel on Linux and T4 (same as docker runtime)
```shell
git clone https://github.com/turboderp/exllamav2
cd exllamav2
python setup.py bdist_wheel
```
If need to rebuild, delete the build folder then run build

Make sure wheel is in nlp/
2. Download model:
```shell
# pretrained mode calibrated on default set
huggingface-cli download LoneStriker/gorilla-openfunctions-v2-5.0bpw-h6-exl2 --local-dir src/models/gorilla-openfunctions-v2-5.0bpw-h6-exl2 --local-dir-use-symlinks False
```
3. Run calibration yourself:
```shell
python exllamav2/convert.py -i nlp/src/models/gorilla-openfunctions-v2 -o nlp/src/models/exl2_tmp/ -cf nlp/src/models/gorilla-openfunctions-v2-5.0bpw-h6-exl2/ -b 5.0 -hb 6
```

# Evaluations
## Pretrained Gorilla OpenFunctionsV2 EXL 5.0bit hb6 calibrated on default set, eval on full train set
Remove duplicate but retry without removing if model cannot find one or more information. If retrying even though nothing has been removed (no 'repeat' in prompt), then remove the prompt that ask it to give None if not found to allow it to hallucinate (cook).

Using weapon instead of tool
- NLP mean score: 0.9679137333565905
- NLP detailed score: {'heading': 0.9968571428571429, 'target': 0.9515214959643531, 'tool': 0.9553625612482756}

Using tool instead of weapon **(BEST)**
- NLP mean score: 0.9688114958493109
- NLP detailed score: {'heading': 0.9965714285714286, 'target': 0.9436904728324896, 'tool': 0.9661725861440147}

Conclusion: Using tool instead of weapon is better, all below result use tool.

With top_p = 0.9
- NLP mean score: 0.9685219499454794
- NLP detailed score: {'heading': 0.9965714285714286, 'target': 0.9433206141197737, 'tool': 0.9656738071452358}

Conclusion: dont use top_p is better, all below result do not specify top_p.

With regex weapon detection (**not** representative as overfitted to train set)
- NLP mean score: 0.9892643084428798
- NLP detailed score: {'heading': 0.9942857142857143, 'target': 0.9740786396143539, 'tool': 0.9994285714285714}

With regex weapon detection and noun enum v1:
- NLP mean score: 0.9409983355064514
- NLP detailed score: {'heading': 0.99, 'target': 0.837852149376497, 'tool': 0.9951428571428571}

Conclusion: spacy as enum is bad as it contain too much noise.

With regex weapon detection and noun as check for LLM target v1: if disagree, use the longest noun as target:
- NLP mean score: 0.9423480519480519
- NLP detailed score: {'heading': 0.9942857142857143, 'target': 0.8333298701298701, 'tool': 0.9994285714285714}

With regex weapon detection and noun as check for LLM target v2: v1 & add to function definition that the target is a descriptive phrase stating appearance and form of target, replace LLM target with longest spacy noun after removing tools:
- NLP mean score: 0.9427309283309283
- NLP detailed score: {'heading': 0.9951428571428571, 'target': 0.8333356421356422, 'tool': 0.9997142857142857}

With regex weapon detection and noun as check for LLM target v3: v2 & keep only the longest noun phrase in LLM-detected target, and keep the same for LLM-detected tool (non regex found), do NOT just replace LLM target with spacy target as LLM is often better:
No work as Spacy will give a single letter as noun phrase

With regex weapon detection fresh from non-spacy, just adjusted prompt to be more descriptive on target and tool **(BEST)**:
- NLP mean score: 0.9947606514556094
- NLP detailed score: {'heading': 0.9957142857142857, 'target': 0.9888533829382569, 'tool': 0.9997142857142857}

With regex weapon detection, moved regex heading to before LLM generation, improve func def to include optional arg " (some of them may be known already)"
- NLP mean score: 0.9844925370925371
- NLP detailed score: {'heading': 0.986, 'target': 0.9817633255633256, 'tool': 0.9857142857142858}
**Have bug**  where target field may be missing, causing entire sample to be empty

With regex weapon detection and color-based regex for target:

with regex weapon detection
- Accuracy: 0.99190173
- Speed Score: 0.81024160 = 17min4s

With regex weapon detection, moved regex heading to before LLM generation, improve func def to include optional arg " (some of them may be known already)"

- Accuracy: 0.9763647907647908
- Speed Score: 0.7861219566666666 = 19min15s like due to many retries

## Pretrained Gorilla OpenFunctionsV2 EXL 5.0bit hb6 calibrated on default set + train set, eval on full train set
without regex weapon detection
- NLP mean score: 0.9645239279239279

Conclusion: custom calibration is bad on OpenFunctionsV2

## Pretrained Gorilla OpenFunctionsV2 EXL 5.0bit hb6 calibrated on default set, eval on test set
with regex weapon detection, with `" It is known that the target is NOT {maybe_known_tool}."` instead of `" It is known that the tool is {maybe_known_tool}."`
